excerpt: BOILERPLATE LAW EQUALS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR AI
---

The legal profession is known for its complexity, attention to detail, and the need for accuracy in all documents and contracts. However, a significant portion of legal work in Canada is boilerplate. In this context, lawyers use past principles and documents from their own work and make changes to names and dates to repurpose that old work for customers. While this practice has some advantages in maintaining objectivity and consistency in a field that requires both, it is also inefficient, as it takes time and resources to review repurposed work. Furthermore, the risk of small mistakes such as typos can have serious consequences.  

Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize the way lawyers work and the speed and accuracy of their output. The use of AI-powered technology can streamline the process of creating and reviewing boilerplate documents, reduce the risk of errors, and ensure that the documents are consistent and objective.  

One of the primary ways AI can assist with boilerplate work is through document automation software. This technology can generate standard legal documents based on predetermined templates and rules. Lawyers can input the necessary information, and the software can create a customized document within minutes, saving significant time and effort. Document automation software can also standardize language and formatting, thereby reducing the risk of errors, such as typos and inconsistencies.  

In addition to document automation, natural language processing (NLP) technology can be used to review and analyze large volumes of legal documents. This technology can assist lawyers in identifying relevant clauses and provisions, detecting and flagging potential inconsistencies, and errors in the language of the documents. With the assistance of NLP, lawyers can ensure that their boilerplate documents are up-to-date, accurate, and relevant.  

Furthermore, AI-powered legal research tools can help lawyers to identify relevant case law, statutes, and regulations. These tools can streamline the research process, enabling lawyers to save time and focus on the unique aspects of each case. Legal research tools can also assist lawyers in identifying the relevant documents and clauses needed to create a boilerplate document that meets their client's specific needs.  

Moreover, AI can assist in the review and updating of boilerplate documents. By leveraging AI-powered technologies, lawyers can ensure that their boilerplate documents are up-to-date and accurate, mitigating the risk of errors and inconsistencies. This can be particularly helpful in cases where multiple versions of a document exist, and it is necessary to compare and consolidate them.  

In conclusion, while the use of boilerplate documents is prevalent in the Canadian legal profession, AI has the potential to mitigate against the drawbacks associated with this practice. By leveraging AI-powered technology such as document automation software, NLP, legal research tools, and document review, lawyers can improve the quality and consistency of their work while also saving time and resources. The use of AI in the legal profession is still in its early stages, and as technology continues to advance, it will undoubtedly play an increasingly essential role in the creation and review of boilerplate documents.
